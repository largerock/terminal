# home sweet home
home is where the heart is and this repo makes that process a whole lot easier. todays day and age has us go through 100 different systems from when you wake to when you sleep so this is a one stop shop for setting up all the nice-to-haves and cool-stuffs in the terminal. follow the simple steps for setup and you'll have a basic setup of oh-my-zsh and starship on linux / macos & powershell / startship on windows. 

if you're unsure you want to make the changes, please save copies of your current configs (.zshrc .zprofile etc..) for future reference or backup.
